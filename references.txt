Difference between <main> and <body>
The main element is used to differentiate the main content of the page from other content such as navigation links or ads.
In summary, the body element represents all the content on the webpage, while the main element represents the main content of the webpage.
Example: 
<body>
  <!-- content goes here -->
  <main>
    <!-- main content goes here -->
  </main>
  <!-- other content goes here -->
</body>
